                                    <p>
                                        Julian is a 22-year-old Colombian game programmer.
                                        He was born in Pasto, a small city in the southern region
                                        of the country. Julian began programming at the age of 15, just 
                                        after graduating from high school. Since then, he has participated
                                        in the development of multiple game projects while
                                        pursuing an engineering degree at UPB (Medellin, Colombia).

                                        Julian's favorite activity is reading. He especially enjoys dark
                                        fantasy and sci-fi books and manga, though recently he has been
                                        exploring horror and comedy genres. He also enjoys learning new
                                        things from time to time, in fact, one more activity he enjoys is
                                        reading about interesting topics on Wikipedia or in scientific articles.
                                        At last, he also enjoys sports and going to the gym, and has been on a
                                        weight-loss journey with some great results!

                                        Julian hopes to become a programmer highly specialized in user interface
                                        implementation. One of his biggest dreams is to work as a UI implementation
                                        lead at renowned game development studios, such as FromSoftware. He also
                                        hopes to own a big apartment and two cats... or maybe even three hehe ;)
